# RGB-LED-With-Arduino-Uno-inbuilt-PWM.
RGB LEDs are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to emit different colors from a single LED. With the help of an Arduino Uno microcontroller board,
you can control the colors of the RGB LED by varying the pulse width modulation (PWM) signals generated by the microcontroller.
To get started with this project, you will need the following components:

 1. Arduino Uno: An Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P microcontroller.

 2. Common Cathode RGB LED: A common cathode RGB LED has three anodes for each color (red, green, and blue) and a shared cathode.
 When you apply voltage to one or more of the anodes and ground the cathode, the LED will light up with the corresponding color(s).
 
 3. 3 x 220 Î© Resistors: The resistors will be used to limit the current flowing through the LED to prevent it from burning out.
 
 4. Jumper Wires: Jumper wires are used to connect the components together.

 5. Arduino IDE: The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application used to write and upload code to the Arduino board.
 
The code is out, if you like to give it a try. (:
